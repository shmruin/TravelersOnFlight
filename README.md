A simple travel scheduler iOS app for all busy travels!
This app is mainly focused on reactive and offline availability.
Without all complex scheduler features, this app has only 3 stage : Travel / Day Schedule / Specific Schedule.
So, one can use it on the airplane very easily - as I wish - and write down their sudden schedule on this small app.
That's what it does!
